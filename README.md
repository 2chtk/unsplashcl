CLI to interact with https://unsplash.com

## Why a new CLI when other tools exist?

Unsplash isn't just a photo-gallery, it's a community of generous photographers and consumers to share free photographs. The existing tools don't handle these attribution and credits to the creators of these photos. They also don't have good clients for Unix and Windows.

In DWoC, with 3-4 sub-projects, we'll try to build a good interface for Unsplash on the command-line, and build additional plugins to handle wall-papers.

It would be used by devs, and users who want to download a collection.
